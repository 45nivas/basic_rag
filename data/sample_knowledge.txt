Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain, allowing it to "learn" from large amounts of data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics.

Computer Vision is a field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects.

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and seeing the results. The agent receives rewards or penalties for the actions it performs, learning to maximize rewards over time.

Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is repurposed on a second related task. This is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point.

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate new content, including text, images, audio, and video. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT are examples of generative AI that can produce human-like text.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that enhances LLMs by providing them with relevant information retrieved from a knowledge base. This allows the model to generate more accurate and contextual responses based on specific documents or data sources.

Vector databases store data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of data. They enable efficient similarity search, making them ideal for applications like semantic search and recommendation systems.

Embeddings are numerical representations of data that capture semantic meaning. In NLP, word embeddings represent words as vectors in a high-dimensional space where similar words are closer together.

The future of AI includes developments in areas such as quantum computing for AI, edge AI for processing data locally on devices, explainable AI for understanding model decisions, and ethical AI to ensure fairness and reduce bias.
